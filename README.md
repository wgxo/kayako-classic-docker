# kayako-classic-docker
Docker scripts for Kayako classic (Swift)

## Usage
Just run the build script and it will generate the environment variables for `.env`

```
sh build.sh
```

You will probably need to change the network interface `eth1` in `build.sh` to fetch the default IP address of your machine.
